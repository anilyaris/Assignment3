# First, a 10-second poll about this assignment period:

Did you go to exercise sessions?
No.
Did you work on the assignment using Aalto computers, your own computers, or both?
I used my own computer.
# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

           R1 Calculating joint positions (1 p): done
                   R2 Rotating the joints (2 p): done
  R3 Visualizing joint coordinate systems (2 p): done
       R4 Skeletal subspace deformation (4 pts): done
                R5 Skinning for normals (1 pts): done

# Did you do any extra credit work?
I implemented SSD on GPU.
# Are there any known problems/bugs remaining in your code?
The stretch of the skin in the animated model is slightly different from how it looks in the example executable (noticeable in the crotch area of the model)
# Did you collaborate with anyone in the class?
No.
# Any other comments you'd like to share about the assignment or the course so far
No.
